Pg. 149, second reference to "All" at bottom of the page should be "Any".

Pg. 179, first paragraph, "memory and time used by your problem". Should "problem" be replaced with "program"?

Pg. 211, Functor instance for State s should be:
instance Functor (State s) where
  fmap f gWithState = \s -> let (gResult, gState) =  g s
  in (f gResult, gState)

Pg. 236, "mplus one works over" seems incorrect.
